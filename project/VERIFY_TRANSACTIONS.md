# How to Verify Real Blockchain Transactions

Currently, the app is in **DEMO MODE** with simulated transactions. Here's how to check if transactions are actually happening on the blockchain:

## Current Status: Simulated Transactions ❌

Right now, the app generates **mock transaction hashes** and doesn't interact with the real blockchain. You'll notice:
- Transactions complete instantly (2 seconds)
- No gas fees are charged
- Transaction hashes are randomly generated
- Nothing appears in your MetaMask activity

## How to Enable Real Blockchain Transactions ✅

To make real transactions happen, you need to:

### 1. Deploy the Smart Contract

```bash
# The smart contract is ready in: contracts/HealthDocumentManager.sol

# You need to:
# - Install Hardhat or Foundry
# - Deploy to Celo Alfajores testnet
# - Get the deployed contract address
```

### 2. Update Contract Address

After deployment, update the contract address in `src/lib/contractConfig.ts`:

```typescript
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = '0xYourDeployedContractAddress';
```

### 3. Use Real Web3 Library

Update `src/lib/web3.ts` to use actual ethers.js v5 or v6 to call contract methods instead of simulations.

## How to Check Real Transactions

Once the contract is deployed and integrated, you can verify transactions:

### Method 1: Celo Block Explorer
1. Copy the transaction hash from the app
2. Visit: https://alfajores.celoscan.io/
3. Paste the transaction hash in the search bar
4. View full transaction details

### Method 2: MetaMask Wallet
1. Open MetaMask extension
2. Click "Activity" tab
3. See all your transactions with status:
   - Pending (⏳)
   - Success (✅)
   - Failed (❌)

### Method 3: In the App
Click "View on Explorer" button next to each transaction to open it in Celoscan.

## What Real Transactions Look Like

Real blockchain transactions will:
- ✅ Take 5-10 seconds to confirm
- ✅ Charge gas fees (paid in CELO)
- ✅ Show "Pending" status in MetaMask
- ✅ Be viewable on Celoscan
- ✅ Have a real transaction hash you can verify
- ✅ Be permanently recorded on the blockchain

## Testing With Testnet

For testing without spending real money:

1. **Get Test CELO**
   - Visit: https://faucet.celo.org/alfajores
   - Enter your wallet address
   - Receive free test CELO

2. **Connect to Alfajores Testnet**
   - Network is auto-configured in the app
   - Your MetaMask should show "Celo Alfajores Testnet"

3. **Make Test Transactions**
   - Upload documents
   - Share with facilities
   - Check transaction on explorer

## Quick Verification Checklist

- [ ] Contract deployed to Celo Alfajores?
- [ ] Contract address updated in `contractConfig.ts`?
- [ ] Web3.ts uses real contract calls (not simulated)?
- [ ] MetaMask shows transaction in activity?
- [ ] Gas fee was charged from your wallet?
- [ ] Transaction hash appears on Celoscan?

## Need Help?

If transactions aren't showing up:
1. Check MetaMask is connected to Celo Alfajores
2. Verify you have CELO for gas fees
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure contract address is correct
5. Confirm smart contract is deployed
